1) PhoneKeypad-LetterCombination

Description:

Given a 7 digit telephone number, print out all the possible combination of letters that can represent the given telephone number. Note that in a standard 12 key pad, 0 and 1 do not have any letters associated with them. They are to br treated as such i.e. a 0/1 in the telephone number will be retained as such in the final word as well. You may use the following mapping between numbers and characters:


0 => 0
1 => 1
2 => abc
3 => def
4 => ghi
5 => jkl
6 => mno
7 => pqrs
8 => tuv
9 => wxyz

g1jjad0,g1jjae0,g1jjaf0,g1jjbd0,g1jjbe0,g1jjbf0,g1jjcd0,g1jjce0,
g1jjcf0,g1jkad0,g1jkae0,g1jkaf0,g1jkbd0,g1jkbe0,g1jkbf0,g1jkcd0,
g1jkce0,g1jkcf0,g1jlad0,g1jlae0,g1jlaf0,g1jlbd0,g1jlbe0,g1jlbf0,....
and so on
